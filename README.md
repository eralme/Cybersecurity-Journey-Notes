## 4.1 Cybersecurity Devices and Technologies

### Security Appliances (6 Categories)
| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Routers** | Direct network traffic |
| **Firewalls** | Control allowed communications |
| **IPS** | Intrusion Prevention System |
| **VPN** | Virtual Private Network |
| **Antivirus/Antimalware** | Detect and remove threats |
| **Other** | Web/email security tools |

---

## Firewalls

> **Key Point:** Control which communications are allowed in/out. Can be software on one computer or a standalone network device.

### Types of Firewalls
| Type | What It Filters |
|------|-----------------|
| **Network Layer** | Source/destination IP |
| **Transport Layer** | Ports, connection states |
| **Application Layer** | Apps, programs, services |
| **Context Aware** | User, device, role, threat profile |
| **Proxy Server** | Web content (URLs, domains, media) |
| **Reverse Proxy** | Hides/distributes web server access |
| **NAT Firewall** | Hides private network addresses |
| **Host-based** | Ports/services on single OS |

---

## Port Scanning
- Each app uses an **assigned port number**
- **Purpose:** Probe computers for open ports
- **Tools:** `nmap`, `zenmap`

---

## IDS vs IPS

| Feature | **IDS** (Detection) | **IPS** (Prevention) |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Action | Alert, detect, log, report | **Block/deny traffic** |
| Response | Passive - no prevention | Active - takes action |

> **Key Difference:** IDS only alerts; IPS actually blocks attacks.

---

## Security Best Practices (NIST Guidelines)

1. Perform **risk assessment**
2. Create a **security policy**
3. Physical security measures
4. Human resources security
5. **Perform and test backups**
6. Maintain **patches and updates**
7. Employ **access controls**
8. Test **incident response**
9. Network monitoring/analytics tools
10. Network security devices
11. **Endpoint security** solutions
12. **Educate users**
13. **Encrypt data**

---

## Behavior-Based Security

> **Definition:** Threat detection by analyzing communication flow. Changes from normal patterns = **anomalies**

### Key Tools
- **Honeypots** - Lure attackers, analyze behavior, build better defenses
- **NetFlow** - Track who/what/when/how users access network

---

## Penetration Testing (5 Steps)

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. **Planning** | Gather information |
| 2. **Scanning** | Active reconnaissance |
| 3. **Gaining Access** | Exploit launch, social engineering, vulnerability exploitation |
| 4. **Maintaining Access** | Trojans, rootkits, covert channels |
| 5. **Analysis & Reporting** | Recommendations for improvements |

---

## Impact Reduction (When Breached)

1. **Communicate** the issue
2. Be **sincere and accountable**
3. Provide **details**
4. Find the **cause**
5. Apply **lessons learned**
6. Check and check again
7. **Educate!**

---

## Risk Management (4 Steps)

> **Goal:** Reduce impact of threats - you can't eliminate risk completely

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1. **Frame** | Identify threats (processes, products, attacks, service disruptions) |
| 2. **Assess** | Quantitative & qualitative analysis |
| 3. **Respond** | Eliminate, mitigate, transfer, or accept |
| 4. **Monitor** | Track accepted risks closely |

## CPU (Central Processing Unit)

> **The Brain** - Executes instructions, performs calculations, manages data flow

### Key Parts
| Part | Function |
|------|----------|
| **ALU** | Arithmetic (add, subtract) + Logic (AND, OR, NOT) |
| **Control Unit** | Coordinates operations, manages data flow |
| **Registers** | Temporary high-speed data storage |

### Key Metrics
| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Cores** | Independent processing units (more = better multitasking) |
| **Threads** | Instruction streams handled simultaneously |
| **Clock Speed** | Cycles per second (GHz) - higher = faster |
| **Cache (L1/L2/L3)** | Fast on-chip memory for frequent data |

> **Analogy:** CPU = Head chef in kitchen. Cores = individual cooks. Threads = chef's ability to multitask. Cache = nearby pantry with common ingredients.

---

## RAM (Random Access Memory)

> **Short-term Memory** - Fast, volatile storage for active data

### Key Points
- **Volatile** = Data lost when power off
- Faster than storage drives
- More RAM = more apps running smoothly

### Key Metrics
| Metric | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Capacity** | 8GB (basic), 16GB (standard), 32GB+ (professional) |
