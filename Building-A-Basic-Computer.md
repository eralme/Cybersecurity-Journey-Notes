# Building a Basic Computer

## Preparation

### Workspace
- Clean, well-lit, static-free area
- Use anti-static mat if on carpet

### Essential Tools
- Phillips head screwdriver (magnetic, #2)
- Anti-static wrist strap (always wear it!)
- Component tray for screws
- Zip ties/velcro for cable management
- Thermal paste (if not pre-applied on cooler)

### Required Components
Case, Motherboard, CPU, CPU Cooler, RAM, GPU (optional), Storage (SSD/HDD), PSU, OS on USB, Monitor/Keyboard/Mouse

## Assembly Steps

### 1. Prepare Case
- Remove side panels
- Install stand-offs matching motherboard form factor (ATX, Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX)
- **Critical:** Stand-offs prevent short circuits

### 2. Install CPU
- Open socket lever
- Align CPU arrow/triangle with socket mark
- **Never force** - bent pins = dead CPU
- Close lever once seated

### 3. Install CPU Cooler
- Apply pea-sized thermal paste (if needed)
- Mount and tighten screws in crisscross pattern
- **Don't over-tighten**

### 4. Install RAM
- Open slot clips
- Align notch with slot
- Press firmly until clips click
- Use correct slots for dual-channel (check manual)

### 5. Mount Motherboard
- Install I/O shield first
- Align with stand-offs
- Secure with screws

### 6. Install GPU
- Use primary PCIe slot (longest one)
- Press until retaining clip closes
- Secure to case with screws
- Connect power cables if required

### 7. Install Storage
- Mount in drive bays
- Connect SATA data cables to motherboard

### 8. Install PSU
- Mount in designated compartment
- Connect: 24-pin (motherboard), 8-pin (CPU), GPU power, SATA power

### 9. Cable Management
- Route behind motherboard tray
- Secure with zip ties
- **Don't block airflow**

### 10. First Boot & BIOS
- Connect peripherals
- Power on, press Delete/F2/F12/Esc for BIOS
- Set boot order to USB first
- Save and exit

### 11. Install OS
- Boot from USB
- Follow installation prompts
- Install drivers (motherboard, GPU, peripherals)

## Key Troubleshooting Tips
- Double-check all connections
- Consult component manuals
- Test components individually
- Seek help from online forums

## Critical Lessons

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| No stand-offs | Short circuit, damaged motherboard |
| Forcing CPU | Bent pins, unusable CPU |
| Insufficient thermal paste | Overheating, poor performance |
| Loose RAM/GPU | Boot failure, instability |
| Poor cable management | Overheating, reduced lifespan |
| Wrong BIOS settings | Boot failure, performance issues |
| Missing drivers | Hardware malfunction |
