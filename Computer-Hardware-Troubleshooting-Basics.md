# Computer Hardware Troubleshooting Basics

A fundamental skill for IT professionals involving systematic identification, diagnosis, and resolution of physical computer component problems.

## Essential Troubleshooting Principles

### The Scientific Method of Troubleshooting

1. **Identify the Problem** - Define the issue, gather information from users, error messages, and logs
2. **Establish a Theory of Probable Cause** - Formulate a hypothesis based on symptoms
3. **Test the Theory** - Verify hypothesis (e.g., swap cables, test components)
4. **Establish a Plan of Action** - Determine the best resolution approach
5. **Implement the Solution** - Follow proper safety procedures
6. **Verify Full System Functionality** - Test thoroughly after fixes
7. **Document Findings** - Record problem, steps, solution, and outcome

### Key Observation Points

- **Visual Cues**: Physical damage, loose connections, dust, bulging capacitors
- **Audible Cues**: Clicking drives, grinding fans, beeping error codes
- **Error Messages**: Note and research specific error codes
- **System Behavior**: Freezes, crashes, unusual startup/shutdown symptoms

### Divide and Conquer Approach

- Start with basics (power, connections)
- Isolate to specific components
- Swap suspected faulty parts with known good ones
- Disconnect unnecessary peripherals

## Common Hardware Problems

| Component | Symptoms | Key Troubleshooting Steps |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------|
| **Power Supply** | Won't turn on, random shutdowns, instability | Check cord/outlet, inspect for damage, test with PSU tester |
| **RAM** | No boot, BSODs, slow performance | Reseat modules, test one at a time, run memory diagnostic |
| **Hard Drive/SSD** | No boot, slow performance, disk errors | Check cables, verify boot order, run CHKDSK/manufacturer diagnostics |
| **Graphics Card** | No/distorted display, artifacts, crashes | Reseat card, update drivers, test different monitor, check temps |
| **Overheating** | Shutdowns, sluggish performance, loud fans | Check fans, clean dust, reapply thermal paste, improve airflow |

## Essential Tools

- **Screwdrivers** (magnetic preferred)
- **Antistatic Wrist Strap** - Prevents ESD damage
- **Compressed Air** - Dust removal
- **Multimeter** - Tests voltage/current/resistance
- **Power Supply Tester** - Tests PSU output levels
- **USB Drive with Diagnostic Tools** - Bootable testing utilities

## Safety Precautions

- Always disconnect power before opening the case
- Use antistatic wrist strap
- Handle components carefully, avoid touching pins/contacts
- Never force connections
- Be aware of sharp case edges
