## Quick Reference

| System | Key Trait | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Desktop** | Modular, upgradeable | Office, gaming, content creation |
| **Laptop** | Portable, all-in-one | Students, travelers, remote work |
| **Workstation** | High-end CPU/GPU, ECC RAM | Engineers, 3D artists, data science |
| **Smartphone** | Pocket-sized, app ecosystem | Communication, on-the-go tasks |
| **Tablet** | Touch-based, mid-size screen | Media, light productivity |
| **Wearable** | Sensor-rich, minimal UI | Fitness, notifications |
| **Server** | 24/7, redundant, headless | Web hosting, databases, file sharing |
| **Mainframe** | Extreme reliability, high throughput | Banks, airlines, government |
| **Supercomputer** | PetaFLOPS, parallel processing | Research, simulations, weather |
| **Embedded** | Dedicated function, real-time | Cars, appliances, IoT, routers |

## Servers

> Provide services to clients over a network

- **24/7 operation** with redundant components (PSU, drives)
- **Multiple CPUs**, large RAM, RAID storage
- **Headless** - managed remotely

**Types:** Web, File, Database, Application

## Mainframe vs Supercomputer

| | Mainframe | Supercomputer |
|-|-----------|---------------|
| **Optimized for** | Transactions/day | Calculations/second |
| **Measured in** | Uptime, throughput | PetaFLOPS |
| **Users** | Banks, government | Research labs |

---

## Embedded Systems

> Dedicated computers hidden inside larger devices

- Single-purpose, resource-constrained, high reliability
- **Examples:** ECU (cars), smart thermostat, routers, pacemakers

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Same components (CPU, RAM, storage) configured differently for purpose
2. Match system to task - don't underprovision
3. Embedded systems are the most common computers (often invisible)
4. Servers/cloud scale with demand
5. Consider total cost: purchase + maintenance + power
